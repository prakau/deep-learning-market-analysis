# Advanced Market Forecasting and Data-Driven Decision Making in India

## Project Overview

This project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning and ensemble techniques for market forecasting and data-driven decision making in the Indian market context. It combines multiple data sources, advanced feature engineering, and a novel ensemble of LSTM and transformer models to provide highly accurate market predictions and actionable insights.

## Features

- Robust data collection pipeline for Indian market data, including stocks, indices, and macroeconomic indicators
- Advanced data preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline
- Implementation of deep learning models:
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks
  - Transformer-based models
  - Novel ensemble combining LSTM and Transformer outputs
- Comprehensive market trend visualization and interactive dashboards
- Automated trading strategy backtesting
- REST API for real-time predictions and integration with other systems
- Comprehensive unit and integration testing suite
- Detailed documentation and Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis
